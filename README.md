## ‚ú® Core Features

-   üîç **SEO Friendly:** A key differentiator! Allows verified search engine crawlers (Googlebot, Bingbot, etc.) to access and index your protected files, so your content remains discoverable.
-   üõ°Ô∏è **Secure File Protection:** Automatically secures the WordPress uploads directory to prevent direct URL access via `.htaccess` or Nginx rules.
-   üîó **Tokenized, Expiring Links:** Generate unique, secure links for your media files that automatically expire after a set time or a specific number of downloads. Perfect for lead-generation forms.
-   üëë **Granular Access Control:** A powerful, multi-layered rules engine to define exactly who can access your files.
    -   **Global Rules:** Set site-wide allow/deny lists for specific users or entire user roles.
    -   **Per-File Rules:** Override global settings for individual files to grant or revoke access.
-   üîÑ **Customizable Redirects:** If a user is denied access, you can redirect them to a global default URL or a custom URL specific to that file.
-   üë§ **Seamless User Integration:**
    -   **Media Library:** Generate protected links with one click.
    -   **Gutenberg Block:** A dedicated "Protected File" block to easily embed protected files.
    -   **Users Page:** Quickly add or remove users from global allow/deny lists directly from the main Users screen.
-   ü§ñ **Reliable Bot Detection:** Uses a combination of User-Agent strings and advanced DNS lookups (rDNS/fDNS) to reliably identify legitimate search engine crawlers and prevent spoofing.

## üß† Advanced Details & FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the access control logic work?</strong></summary>

The plugin checks for access permissions in a strict, prioritized order. The first rule that matches a user grants or denies access, and processing stops. This ensures predictable behavior. The priority is:

1.  **User-Specific Rules:** Is the user on a global or per-file `Allow` or `Deny` list? User-specific rules are checked first.
2.  **Role-Based Rules:** Does the user's role appear on a global or per-file `Allow` or `Deny` list?
3.  **Bot Check:** Is the visitor a verified search engine bot?
4.  **Token Check:** Does the visitor have a valid, unexpired access token?
5.  **Default:** If none of the above grant access, the request is denied and the user is redirected.

<summary><strong>How do I configure my server? (Apache/Nginx)</strong></summary>

For file protection, requests to `/wp-content/uploads/` must reach WordPress. Access Lens now writes these rewrite rules automatically and regenerates them for each directory that contains protected files. You can view the current snippets on the **Settings > Access Lens** page. If you need to add them manually, use the following examples.

**Apache (`.htaccess` file in your WordPress root)**

Place these rules *before* the main WordPress block:
```htaccess
# BEGIN Access Lens
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f
    # Rule generated for each protected directory
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/wp-content/uploads/<directory>/.+\.(<exts>)$ [NC]
    RewriteRule ^wp-content/uploads/<directory>/(.*)$ wp-content/plugins/protected-media-links/pml-handler.php?pml_media_request=$1 [QSA,L]
    # Additional directories have similar rules
</IfModule>
# END Access Lens
```

**Nginx (`nginx.conf` file)**

Add this `location` block inside your `server` block. It should come before the general `location /` block.
```nginx
location ~ ^/wp-content/uploads/<directory>/.+\.(<exts>)$ {
    if (!-f $request_filename) {
        return 404;
    }
    rewrite ^/wp-content/uploads/<directory>/(.*)$ /wp-content/plugins/protected-media-links/pml-handler.php?pml_media_request=$1 last;
    # Additional location blocks are generated automatically
}
```

If you have an Nginx `internal` location or a LiteSpeed equivalent, define a constant in `wp-config.php` so the handler can offload file delivery:

```php
define( 'PML_INTERNAL_REDIRECT_PREFIX', '/pml-secure-files/' );
```

Set the value to your internal location path. The handler will then emit `X-Accel-Redirect` or `X-LiteSpeed-Location` headers.

## üî≠ Scope: What This Plugin Is & Isn't

It's important to understand the scope of this plugin to ensure it meets your needs.

#### ‚úîÔ∏è This Plugin IS:
- A tool to **protect direct URL access** to files in the WordPress Media Library.
- A solution for **balancing SEO with lead generation** by allowing bots to crawl gated content.
- A flexible **access control system** based on users, roles, and temporary tokens.
- A system that **integrates deeply** into the WordPress admin interface.

#### ‚ùå This Plugin IS NOT:
- **A full Digital Rights Management (DRM) system.** It does not encrypt files or prevent a user from sharing a file *after* they have downloaded it.
- **A membership plugin.** It does not handle subscriptions, payments, or content dripping, but it can work alongside plugins that do by leveraging user roles.
- **A solution for externally hosted files** (e.g., Amazon S3, Dropbox). It is designed only for files hosted on the same server as WordPress.
- **A tool for on-the-fly file modification,** such as PDF watermarking.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether it's reporting a bug, suggesting a feature, or submitting a pull request, your help is appreciated. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

-   **WordPress Coding Standards:** All code must follow the official WordPress standards.
-   **Prefix Everything:** All functions, classes, and hooks must be prefixed with `pml_` to prevent conflicts.
-   **Security First:** Use nonces, capability checks, and proper sanitization/escaping on all data.

Please open an issue or pull request on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TWP-Technologies/Access-Lens).

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Notes

-   **Class map generator:** Run `php build/generate-class-map.php` from the command line whenever classes are added or files are renamed under `includes/`. The script must be executed via the CLI (it will exit early otherwise) and respects the optional `PML_PLUGIN_DIR_FOR_BUILD` constant if the plugin lives outside the default directory layout. A successful run regenerates `includes/pml-class-map.php` with paths relative to the includes directory.
-   **Release packaging:** WordPress distribution archives created with tools such as `wp dist-archive` automatically exclude the `build/` directory via `.distignore`, ensuring development-only assets are left out of release zips.
